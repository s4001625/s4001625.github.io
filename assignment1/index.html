          When I arrived at the home page, the loading page caught my attention.
          After it finished, I focused on the elements on the home page, which
          is a bit crowded but still looks elegant. Also, the website's
          scrolling effect is interesting since it has a unique movement that
          not many other websites have.

        <p class="answer1">
          The discipline section of the website because each project has its
          color. When we move our mouse near or on top of the picture, it can
          follow our mouse angle. For example, if our mouse is at the picture's
          bottom left corner, it will automatically tilt, looking like the
          bottom left corner is the center point.

        <p class="answer1">
          I'm playing with the line that follows the cursor and activating the
          big circle. I'm also moving back and forth on the website to see the
          transitions between each section and focus more on how it is
          displayed. But the most common one is changing colors between the
          projects' background.

        <p class="answer1">
          It's very creative, and each result of the work is structured in each
          section, which makes it accessible. However, it's hard to figure out
          how to go back to the gallery page if I click on one of them. I love
          the color choices and the fonts. The transitions are very flowy and
          smooth when changing each section.

        <p class="answer1">
          It communicates through a simple design with a structured layout. The
          buttons for contact information, biography, and works are easy to
          navigate. The interactive links allows users to engage deeper with
          Brown's work by understanding his expertise and allowing people to
          explore his works without searching from external page.
