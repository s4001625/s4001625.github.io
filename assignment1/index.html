        When I arrived at the home page, the loading page caught my attention.
        After it finished, I focused on the elements on the home page, which is
        a bit crowded but still looks elegant. Also, the website's scrolling
        effect is interesting since it has a unique movement that not many other
        websites have.

        1. Playing with the mouse arrow. <br />
        2. Trying to figure out which element or object is clickable. <br />
        3. Figuring out how to change the background colour for each project.
        <br />
        4. Clicking on video that is shown on the main page for the projects.

        <br />The discipline section of the website because each discipline has
        its color. When we move our mouse near or on top of the picture, it can
        follow our mouse angle. For example, if our mouse is at the picture's
        bottom left corner, it will automatically tilt, looking like the bottom
        left corner is the center point.
